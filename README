has_permalink
============

A plugin for generating url-safe permalink-string from any other attribute in the same ActiveRecord model.

The string is generated by the before_validation callback.


Example
=======

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_permalink
end

$ Post.new(:title => "Title with swedish charachters like this ä åöö äö in it")
$ Post.save
$ Post.permalink = "title-with-swedish-charachters-like-this-a-aoo-ao-in-it"

The permalink attribute is not transformed unless it's blank.

The plugin assumes that the permalink attribute is generated from the title attribute but it can be changed by providing the field_to_generate_from option:

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_permalink(:field_to_generate_from => :heading)
end
