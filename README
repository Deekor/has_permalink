has_permalink
=============

A plugin for generating url-safe permalink-string from any other attribute in the same ActiveRecord model.

The string is generated by the before_validation callback.

Installation
============

put this in your gemfile:

gem "has_permalink"

And run in your terminal:

bundle install

If your model doesn’t already have the permalink attribute you can run this generator command:

rails g has_permalink [Model]

That will generate a migration which adds a permalink attribute [Model] and indexes it. Don’t forget to:

rake db:migrate

Example
=======

The permalink attribute is generated by the before_validation callback and is only transformed if it’s blank.

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_permalink
end

The plugin assumes that the permalink attribute is generated from the title attribute but it can be changed by providing an argument like this:

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_permalink :heading
end
